# Description
 This project uses PyTorch to create and train a neural network that predicts the results of League of Legends games

# How it works
First, we used urllib to scrape data from the website OP.GG which hosts publicly available League of Legends match data. We then used regular expressions and the pandas library in order to clean and process the data in order to train our binary classification model (utilizing PyTorch).
